You have been hired to produce a system for a humane society.
Requirements:
   Console Application
   Must be able to add an animal to the system and track animals in the system
   Must be able to remove an animal from the system and collect money from an adopter
   Must be able to track which animals have had their shots and give animals their shots if have not received it yet
   Must be able to categorize animals in the system. This also involves which cage the animal is located in.
   Adopters should have a profile. If an adopter adopts an animal, it should say which animal in the system. That means the same animal must be removed from the system.
   Keep track of the food the animals need. This means dog will need x amount of dog feed per week, etc. Different animals need different food.
   NO HARD CODED DATA. ALL DATA MUST COME FROM USER INPUT. You can read/write from a file but the data in the file must come from user input initially. 
   Persistent data -- if I turn the program off, the animals must still be there. (Hint: this means writing to a file)
